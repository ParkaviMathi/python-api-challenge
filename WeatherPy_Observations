The observable trends based on the analysis of the WeatherPy Challenge using the Linear Regression on the Scatter Plots are:
1.	While the Temperature tended to increase constantly as the distance of the Cities to the Equator(Latitude=0) in the Southern Hemisphere, it was varying in the Northern Hemisphere.
2.	The Humidity was above 60 for most cities in the Northern Hemisphere irrespective of the Latitude, while in the Southern Hemisphere, the Humidity was around 60 to 80 in average.
3.	The distance from the Equator did not have any effect on the Cloudiness of the City in both Northern and Southern Hemisphere.
